# Wundergram

Wundergram is a simple Telegram bot which sends reminders from Wunderlist tasks

Just send */start* message, authorize in Wunderlist and send the bot your location so that it knew your timezone. And than you'be able to get daily notifications with today's tasks lists.

Wundergram uses 'Due date' task field to detect if the task should be done today.

### v0.1.1
- Detecting user's timezone through location and saving it to send notifications just in time

### v0.1.0
Initial release
